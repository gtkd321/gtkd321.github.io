There comes a time on a cold day at the beach when you jump in anyway.

If I said I were ready now, it might imply I was not ready yesterday.  Ready is as ready does.  I have been ready for a while and that is evidenced by the strange feeling of familiarity that peeks through in little moments and says, "You've always wanted this"...When your brain was firing and firing, looking for work and meaning...When you geeked out with any interesting person you could...Falling in love with minds again and again...When you asked how to tie together the whirlwind of ideas..."Will I ever meet all the people I'd need to to make these ideas real?  Where are they hiding?"  They are probably hiding behind a keyboard, making it happen already.  When I see into the mind of a programmer, chiefly by reading what they write to the layman, but also to the initiate, I see a world of communicators...but not only communicators--doers.

This is what has me excited.  Doers.

*Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be.
â€• Shel Silverstein*
